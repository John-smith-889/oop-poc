## Printing classes

Repository contains files "printing_class.py" and "printing_class_2.py". Files contain classes which objects may print multiples of strings given as arguments. Class in file "printing_class_2.py" inherits from class in file "printing_class.py". Repository consists also file "run.py" with scripts which initialize classes and run methods.  

During initialization 2 parameters are required to pass. Parameters may be strings or numbers.

Printing classes may be treated as a template for object oriented python programs.
